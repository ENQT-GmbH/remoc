//! A multi-producer, multi-consumer broadcast queue with receivers that may be located on remote endpoints.
//!
//! Each sent value is seen by all consumers.
//! The senders must be local, while the receivers can be sent to
//! remote endpoints.
//! Forwarding is supported.
//!
//! This has similar functionality as [tokio::sync::broadcast] with the additional
//! ability to work over remote connections.
