//! Remoc ðŸ¦‘ â€” remote multiplexed objects and channels
//!
//! Remoc makes remote interaction between Rust programs seamless and smooth.
//! Over a [single underlying transport], such as TCP or TLS, it provides:
//!
//!   * [multiple channels] of different types like [MPSC], [oneshot], [watch], etc.,
//!   * [remote synchronization] primitives,
//!   * calling of [remote functions] and [trait methods] on a remote object (RPC),
//!   * [remotely observable collections].
//!
//! Remoc is written in 100% safe Rust, builds upon [Tokio], works with any type
//! and [data format] supported by [Serde] and does not depend on any particular
//! [transport type].
//!
//! [single underlying transport]: Connect
//! [multiple channels]: rch
//! [MPSC]: rch::mpsc
//! [oneshot]: rch::oneshot
//! [watch]: rch::watch
//! [remote synchronization]: robj
//! [remote functions]: rfn
//! [trait methods]: rtc
//! [Tokio]: tokio
//! [data format]: codec
//! [Serde]: serde
//! [transport type]: Connect
//! [remotely observable collections]: robs
//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! A common pattern in Rust programs is to use channels to communicate between
//! threads and async tasks.
//! Setting up a channel is done in a single line and it largely avoids the need
//! for shared state and the associated complexity.
//! Remoc extends this programming model to distributed systems by providing
//! channels that work seamlessly over remote connections.
//!
//! For that it uses Serde to serialize and deserialize data as it gets transmitted
//! over an underlying transport,
//! which might be a [TCP network connection], a WebSocket, [UNIX pipe],
//! or even a [serial link].
//!
//! Opening a new [channel] is straightforward, just send the sender or receiver half
//! of the new channel over an existing channel, like you would do between local
//! threads and tasks.
//! All channels are multiplexed over the same remote connection, with data being
//! transmitted in chunks to avoid one channel blocking another if a large message
//! is transmitted.
//!
//! Building upon its remote channels, Remoc allows calling of [remote functions] and
//! closures.
//! Furthermore, a trait can be made [remotely callable] with automatically generated
//! client and server implementations, resembling a classical remote procedure
//! calling (RPC) model.
//!
//! [TCP network connection]: https://docs.rs/tokio/1.12.0/tokio/net/struct.TcpStream.html
//! [UNIX domain sockets]: https://docs.rs/tokio/1.12.0/tokio/net/struct.UnixStream.html
//! [UNIX pipe]: https://docs.rs/tokio/1.12.0/tokio/process/struct.Child.html
//! [serial link]: https://docs.rs/tokio-serial/5.4.1/tokio_serial/
//! [channel]: rch
//! [remotely callable]: rtc
//!
//! # Forward and backward compatibility
//!
//! Distributed systems often require that endpoints running different software
//! versions interact.
//! By utilizing a data format like [Postbag](postbag) for encoding of your data
//! for transport, you can ensure a high level of backward and forward compatibility.
//!
//! It is always possible to add new fields to enums and struct and utilize the
//! `#[serde(default)]` attribute to provide default values for that field if it
//! was sent by an older client that has no knowledge of it.
//! Likewise additional, unknown fields are silently ignored when received,
//! allowing you to extend the data format without disturbing legacy endpoints.
//!
//! Check the documentation of the employed data format for details.
//!
//! # Crate features
//!
//! The modules of Remoc are gated by crate features, as shown in the reference below.
//! For ease of use all features are enabled by default.
//! See the [codec module](codec) documentation on how to select a default codec.
//!
//! ### JavaScript and web support
//!
//! Remoc supports compiling to the WebAssembly targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown`,
//! `wasm32-wasip1` and `wasm32-wasip1-threads`. If you are targeting a JavaScript
//! execution environment (like a web browser) you must enable the `js` crate feature.
//! This will enable JavaScript promises support and spawn tasks onto the browser's
//! native event queue.
//!
//! # Tracing
//!
//! Remoc uses the [Tracing crate](tracing) for logging of events.
//! Setting the log level to `TRACE` logs multiplexer lifetime events and messages as they are being processed.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! This is a short example; for a fully worked remote trait calling (RTC) example
//! see the [examples directory](https://github.com/ENQT-GmbH/remoc/tree/master/examples).
//!
//! In the following example the server listens on TCP port 9870 and the client connects to it.
//! Then both ends establish a Remoc connection using [Connect::io] over the TCP connection.
//! The connection dispatchers are spawned onto new tasks and the `client()` and `server()` functions
//! are called with the established [base channel](crate::rch::base).
//!
//! Then, the client creates a new [remote MPSC channel](crate::rch::mpsc) and sends it inside
//! a count request to the server.
//! The server receives the count request and counts on the provided channel.
//! The client receives each counted number over the new channel.
//!
